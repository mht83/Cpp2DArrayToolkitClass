- `void fill(T value)`: Fills the entire matrix with the specified value.
- `T& at(size_t row, size_t col)`: Accesses the element at the specified row and column.
- `T& data(T value)`: Finds and returns a reference to the first occurrence of the specified value in the matrix.
- `void capacity()`: Prints the current capacity of the matrix in terms of row and column count.
- `void swap(T a, T b)`: Swaps two elements in the matrix by their values.
- `size_t rowCount() const`: Returns the number of rows in the matrix.
